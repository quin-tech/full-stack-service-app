## Description

SkillMagnet is a job board to sell and hire services that one might need asistance or particular skills to complete. It is a web application designed to make it easier to find, contact, and pay for jobs such as babysitting, handyman work, etc. SkillMagnet is free to use and doesn't take a profit off of sold services, making it easier for members of the community to market themselves and support each other's businesses. 

In this project, every member of Quin-tech better learned how to implement MERN, React, GraphQl, Redux, and React frameworks.
